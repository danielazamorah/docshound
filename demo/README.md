# DocsHound OpenCode stage demo

This folder contains a repeatable, live-data demo of DocsHound finding two real
gaps in OpenCode's CLI reference and publishing the reviewed change to a fork.
The preflight is read-only: it does not sync the fork, create branches, or open
pull requests.

## One-command start

From the DocsHound repository root:

```bash
./demo/run.sh opencode
```

Stop any ordinary `./run.sh` process first; the demo launch deliberately fails
instead of silently switching ports when `5173` or `8000` is already occupied.

That command selects the `docshound-opencode-demo` LangSmith project, runs every
preflight check, enables the pinned OpenCode scenario, and launches the backend
and frontend.

- DocsHound: <http://127.0.0.1:5173>
- Traces: <https://smith.langchain.com>

Stop DocsHound with `Ctrl+C`. Trace history remains available in LangSmith.

## Credentials

Put these in the root `.env` or `backend/.env` before running the demo:

```text
GITHUB_TOKEN=github_pat_...

# Google Cloud Vertex AI (Recommended - zero API keys needed with ADC)
VERTEX_PROJECT=your-gcp-project-id
VERTEX_LOCATION=global

# OR optional Merge Gateway fallback:
# MERGE_GATEWAY_API_KEY=...

LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_...
```

Use one GitHub token that can read the public OpenCode repository and can write
to `MatthewFeroz/opencode`. The fork needs Contents and Pull requests read/write
access. The preflight validates the authenticated account, fork relationship,
push permission, live model access, LangSmith access, and the exact source files
without printing any secret. Keep the token in the ignored root `.env` or
`backend/.env`; the demo homepage verifies the server-managed token without
displaying it or asking you to paste it into the browser.

## Stage flow

1. Run `./demo/run.sh opencode` before presenting. Do not proceed if preflight
   reports a failure.
2. Paste `anomalyco/opencode` into the main Repository field.
3. Wait for GitHub access to show **READY**. DocsHound verifies the token already
   configured on the server; no token field is shown.
4. In Official documentation, use **Change source** and select
   `MatthewFeroz/opencode`. Keep the detected root
   `packages/web/src/content/docs`.
5. Start the run. The trace should show exactly these live sources:
   - `anomalyco/opencode#42484` — document non-interactive `mcp add`
   - `anomalyco/opencode#41537` — document mini/replay CLI flags
   - `anomalyco/opencode#31054` — merged implementation for non-interactive
     `mcp add`
6. Review a finding, approve it, and preview the update to
   `packages/web/src/content/docs/cli.mdx`.
7. Create the pull request in `MatthewFeroz/opencode`.

Open LangSmith during the run and choose the `docshound-opencode-demo` project
to show the agent, tool, chain, and model spans. These are the same
OpenTelemetry spans DocsHound can later route to another OTLP backend, enriched
with OpenInference semantics. Repository source references are recorded on the
analysis spans without copying issue or document bodies into custom attributes.

## Rehearsal commands

Run the checks without launching the product:

```bash
./demo/preflight.sh opencode
```

Run the entire agent pipeline through a real patch preview without creating a
branch or pull request on GitHub:

```bash
./demo/rehearse.sh opencode
```

This is the strongest safe check to run before stage time. It fetches the exact
live issues and merged PR, requires two findings that cover every pinned source,
searches the fork's full documentation corpus, drafts both changes, and proves
that each patch updates the existing `packages/web/src/content/docs/cli.mdx`.
It uses a temporary local database and deletes it afterward.

The fork's `dev` branch is intentionally held at the commit pinned in the
scenario manifest. That stable snapshot preserves the known documentation gaps
for the stage demo, so do not sync it immediately before presenting. The
preflight fails if the fork moves away from the pinned commit.

## How it works

- [`scenarios/opencode.json`](scenarios/opencode.json) is the stage manifest. It
  pins two issues and one merged PR, their exact titles and states, the source
  and publish commits, the docs target, implementation markers, and the Merge
  Gateway model.
- [`preflight.py`](preflight.py) verifies every volatile dependency against
  GitHub and Merge Gateway. It also checks that the CLI implementation still
  contains the behavior while the target docs still omit it. If OpenCode closes
  an issue, changes a title, fills the gap, or the token loses publish access,
  the demo stops before you go on stage.
- [`rehearse.py`](rehearse.py) exercises the complete read-only workflow through
  patch generation. It deliberately stops before the GitHub branch/commit/PR
  calls, making it safe to run repeatedly.
- Setting `DOCSHOUND_DEMO_SCENARIO=opencode` makes repository research call the
  normal GitHub API endpoints for only those pinned sources. No issue bodies or
  model output are stored as fixtures. A source-coverage guardrail links issue
  `#42484` to its earlier implementation PR and prevents a model response from
  silently dropping a pinned issue.
- [`run.sh`](run.sh) selects `docshound-opencode-demo` as the LangSmith project.
  The backend sends its canonical OpenTelemetry/OpenInference spans directly to
  LangSmith over OTLP; an explicit standard OTLP endpoint can replace that
  destination later without changing agent instrumentation.
- [`research/opencode-sources.md`](research/opencode-sources.md) records why
  these sources were selected and the code/documentation evidence behind them.

Outside `DOCSHOUND_DEMO_SCENARIO`, DocsHound keeps its normal behavior and
researches recent repository activity instead of using the demo manifest.

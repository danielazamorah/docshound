DocsHound turns open issues and merged pull requests into grounded, reviewable
documentation updates.

The project contains two independently deployable applications:

- `frontend/` — React, TypeScript, and Vite static application
- `backend/` — FastAPI JSON/SSE API and agent runtime

Credentials submitted through the local connection panels are sent directly to
the backend, held only in process memory, and never returned by the API.

## Run locally

Requires Python 3.14, uv 0.12+, and Bun 1.3+.

Set up the backend:

```bash
cd backend
uv sync --locked
cp .env.example .env
cd ..
```

Backend dependencies are declared in `backend/pyproject.toml` and reproducibly
resolved by `backend/uv.lock`. Refresh them deliberately with
`cd backend && uv lock --upgrade && uv sync`.

Set up the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
bun install
cd ..
```

Start both development servers:

```bash
./run.sh
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173). Vite proxies `/api`
requests to the backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

You can also run each application independently:

```bash
./backend/run.sh
bun run --cwd frontend dev
```

## OpenCode stage demo

The repeatable stage setup, pinned live GitHub sources, read-only preflight, and
LangSmith trace configuration live in [`demo/`](demo/README.md). Start the
complete demo environment with:

```bash
./demo/run.sh opencode
```

## Backend configuration

Add credentials to `backend/.env` (or a root `.env` for compatibility with
existing local installations):

```text
APP_ENV=development   # set to production to disable browser key entry
GITHUB_TOKEN=          # optional server token for scans and documentation PRs
MERGE_GATEWAY_API_KEY= # recommended: model-based analysis through Gateway
MERGE_GATEWAY_PRIMARY_MODEL=google/gemini-3.7-flash
MERGE_GATEWAY_FALLBACK_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.6-luna
OPENAI_API_KEY=        # optional legacy direct-provider fallback
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=     # default OTLP trace destination
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=docshound
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173
DOCSHOUND_DB_PATH=     # optional: explicit shared SQLite path
```

For automatic forks of arbitrary public repositories, use a classic GitHub
token with the `public_repo` scope. GitHub requires Administration write access
to create a fork with a fine-grained token, so fine-grained tokens are best for
direct writes or reusing a fork you already created; give that fork Contents and
Pull requests read/write access.

## Frontend configuration

`VITE_API_BASE_URL` is the only frontend environment variable. Set it to the
public backend origin for independent deployments:

```text
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
```

Values prefixed with `VITE_` are public and embedded in the browser bundle.
Never place Merge Gateway, model-provider, or GitHub credentials in the
frontend environment.

In local development, a server-managed `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically verified
for the repository entered on the homepage without being sent to or displayed
in the browser. This is the recommended setup for repeatable demos. When no
server token is configured, the readiness checklist can accept one GitHub token
for repository research and documentation pull requests. The model connection
menu can similarly send a Merge Gateway key to the backend. Browser-provided
overrides are held only in backend process memory and cleared on restart. DocsHound
automatically resolves the official documentation repository and folder from
repository structure, README links, the GitHub homepage, and “Edit this page on
GitHub” links. The detected source is shown before each run and can be
overridden.

Pull-request previews always use that upstream documentation repository. Only
after approval does DocsHound resolve a write destination: it writes directly
when permitted, otherwise it reuses the connected account's fork or creates one,
then opens the pull request against upstream. If GitHub permits the fork and
commit but requires browser confirmation for the cross-fork pull request,
DocsHound links directly to the prefilled upstream comparison page.

For a confirmed documentation root containing at most 100 Markdown or MDX
pages, an authenticated run reads the complete corpus before ranking the best
eight pages per finding. Larger roots use a bounded search of up to 100 pages.
When documentation lives in a separate repository, its issues and merged pull
requests can also be included as documentation-specific evidence. Browser
credential entry is disabled when `APP_ENV` is `production`; production
deployments should inject `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `MERGE_GATEWAY_API_KEY` through the
server's secret manager.

### OpenTelemetry and OpenInference tracing

DocsHound produces one vendor-neutral OpenTelemetry trace stream enriched with
OpenInference semantics. Each run is an OpenInference `AGENT` span, repository
operations are `TOOL` spans, and the LangChain, LangGraph, and OpenAI-compatible
Gateway calls beneath them are instrumented automatically. Model spans include
the requested provider/model, the model returned by Gateway, and whether
DocsHound used its fallback route.

Set a LangSmith API key to use LangSmith as the default OTLP destination:

```text
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_...
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=docshound
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=docshound
```

The LangSmith SDK's native tracing switch is intentionally unnecessary: spans
go directly to LangSmith's OTLP endpoint, avoiding a duplicate trace tree.
Explicit `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` or
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` configuration takes precedence, making it
possible to route the same spans to an OpenTelemetry Collector or a future
Google exporter without changing agent code. Standard options including
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`, `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`, and
`OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` are supported. Set `OPENINFERENCE_HIDE_INPUTS=true` and/or
`OPENINFERENCE_HIDE_OUTPUTS=true` when model content must not be captured by
automatic instrumentation. DocsHound's custom spans record repository identity,
the selected documentation repository and root, source references, and result
summaries—not credentials or issue, pull-request, and document bodies.

## Docker

Build and run both applications locally:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). The backend is available at
`http://localhost:8000`, with persistent SQLite data in a named Docker volume.

Each directory also has its own Dockerfile, so the frontend and backend can be
built, deployed, scaled, and rolled back separately. Configure the backend's
`ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with the deployed frontend origin.

## Google Cloud Platform (Vertex AI Agent Runtime & Cloud Run)

DocsHound can be deployed serverless to GCP:
- **Vertex AI Agent Runtime**: Host the LangGraph agent as a managed Reasoning Engine (`backend/deploy_agent_runtime.py`).
- **Cloud Run**: Deploy the FastAPI backend and Vite frontend independently with automatic scaling.
- **Gemini 3.7 Flash**: High-speed, multimodal intelligence for gap identification and documentation drafting.

See [`docs/DEPLOYMENT_GCP.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GCP.md) for full deployment instructions and Agents CLI evaluation commands.

## API

The versioned backend API is under `/api/v1`. Interactive OpenAPI documentation
is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

Start a run:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/runs \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"repo":"GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog","limit":50}'
```

Resolve and confirm documentation sources before a run:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/sources/resolve \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"repo":"kubernetes/kubernetes"}'
```

Then fetch its state or subscribe to JSON server-sent events:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/runs/<RUN_ID>
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/runs/<RUN_ID>/events
```

Completed run responses and `run_completed` events include a user-facing
`outcome` and `summary`. Outcomes distinguish recommendations from
`no_activity`, `no_recommendations`, `partial_failure`, and `failed`, so clients
never have to infer an empty result from counters or mistake a recoverable tool
error for a successful run.

The API also exposes findings, approval/rejection, approved documents,
repository patch previews, patch downloads, and pull-request creation.

For compatibility with existing integrations, `POST /runs`,
`GET /runs/{run_id}`, and `GET /runs/{run_id}/events.json` remain available as
aliases for the original DocsHound API contract. New integrations should use
the versioned `/api/v1` routes.

## Persistence

The backend stores local application state in `backend/data/docshound.db`. Set
`DOCSHOUND_DB_PATH` when a deployment needs an explicit shared location.

The database includes completed runs, findings, approved document revisions,
prepared patches, and created pull-request metadata.

SQLite and the in-process event stream are appropriate for a single backend
replica. A multi-replica deployment should use shared persistence and event
delivery before scaling horizontally.

## Tests

Run backend tests:

```bash
cd backend
uv lock --check
uv run ruff check app tests ../demo
PYTHONWARNINGS='error::ResourceWarning' \
  uv run --locked python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Run frontend checks:

```bash
cd frontend
bun run format:check
bun run typecheck
bun run test
bun run build
```

GitHub Actions runs the same locked backend and frontend checks, then builds
both Docker images with `docker compose build`.
